The files in this directory are simple PCL samples to print a table of
characters 128 - 255 for various PCL symbol sets. The tables may show
some differences to real PCL symbol sets, as some characters do not
exist in any CaPSL graphic set. 

Legals.pcl and legalp.pcl produce identical output. The difference is
in the selection method: legalp.pcl selects HPLegal as a primary
symbol set and prints characters 0..127 wheras legals.pcl selects it
as a secondary set and prints characters 128..255.

The files are hand-edited copies of an AmiPro document printed with a
LaserJet driver (I forget which one, most likely LJIIp) from Windows
3.1.
